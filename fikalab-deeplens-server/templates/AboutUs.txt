Development Team

The I See You team is a group of engineering students focused on the creation of an inteligent lens prototype capable of recognizing humans amongst other visual elements and identifying faces with high precision. Our project Deep Lens is motivated by the Summer Innovation Week at CRITICAL Software and has the purpose of introducing us students, Filipe Pires, Hugo Marques, Inês Valentim, João Carvalho and João Martins, to the world of Deep Learning in a very practical way. 

The project's mentors, Diana Mendes, Jason Bolito and Samuel Pedro, prepared a set of 3 milestones to be implemented by the development team, providing us with the AWS DeepLens Camera, its detection and recognition models (already trained) and the deployment scripts for the camera system and allowing us to go beyond the propositions. After 3 days of intense planning, learning and programming, the result is a web service with a live stream of the video processed by the AWS camera and broadcasted to the clients via a server. The viewer can then choose whether to see how many elements are detected by the camera (including simple objects such as chairs and tables, as well as humans) or who's face is looking at the camera (giving the person's name if he/she is in the database).
